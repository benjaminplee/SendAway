# SendAway

Simple mock location app useful for testing other Android apps.

Allows other applications (e.g. instrumented tests built with Espresso or UIAutomator)
 to broadcast an intent to change the mock location without requiring the application
 under test (or the test-app) to have mock location permissions or be set as the mock-location app for API 23+.
