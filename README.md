# SendAway

Simple mock location app useful for testing other Android apps.

Allows other applications (e.g. instrumented tests like Espresso or
UIAutomator) to broadcast an intent to change the mock location
without requiring the application under test (or the test-app) to have mock location permissions or be set as the mock-location app for API 23+.
